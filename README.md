# Welcome to Markscheme

![Am-I-Responsive-Image](media/Readme-files/am-i-responsive.png)

Markscheme is an online ecommerce store that allows teachers and tutors to advertise and sell educational products to children and teenages who are preparing for exams. The store allows the owners to create two types of products: Workshops and Digital Downloads. Interested users can purchase a ticket to a workshop or purchase a digital download to help them improve their knowledge of topics they plan to take exams for.

## User Stories
To access and read the user stories for this project, see my Github project [Markscheme User Stories](https://github.com/users/adamsburge/projects/4/views/1). Many of these user stories were taken from the Code Institute 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough project. However, some are unique to this project.

## Databse Structures
The database models used for this project were expanded from the models used in Code Institute's 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough project. However, these have been adjusted and added to for the purpose of the current project. Notably, this project uses polymorphism to allow for inherited models which extend the use of the product model thereby allowing for more than one kind of product (i.e., Workshops and Digital Products). Additionally, this project expands the user model beyond that created Code Institute's in the Boutique Ado project.

Additionally, the current project has one extra model not depicted in the database schema belowâ€”the updates model. This model is used to store news/updates regarding both digital products and workshops. This model can be found in the [models.py file of the products app](products/models.py).

## Features for Site Visitors and Normal Users

<details>
<summary>Sign up, Sign in, Sign Out</summary>
Any site visitor can register for an account. Once they have done so, they can sign in and out.
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>View Posted Updates to Products</summary>
Any site visitor is able to see updates that have been listed for both workshops and digital products. This allows the customer to make an informed decision when considering purchasing the product as it allows them to see the developments the product has had over time. 
<br>
<br>
However, site users are only able to see product updates which the superusers have indicated is a 'Major Update' (which the superuser does by checking a box when updating the product). This allows the superusers to update the products and only show updates to site users that are relevant to the customer. For example, a superuser might choose to indicate that a new release of a handbook is a major update, but indicate that correcting a typo in the description is a minor update and consequently not something the customer needs to be aware of.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Browse the Website, Purchase Products</summary>
All site visitors can access the home, about, staff pages as well as the checkout process. Site visitors have the option to registor for an account when checkout out and consequently keep track of their purchases.

# Credits
- Deployment aesthetic:
    - The general layout of this app is based on Code Institute's Boutique Ado project The aesthetic, however, is my own design and was made with adobe color.
- Concept:
    - The concept of this app is my own.
- Content:
    - The content of this website is entirely fictitious.
    - The photos on this site come from UnSplash and I am very grateful for the photographers who provided such incredible photos
    - The no_image file used for when there is no image to display, comes from [this wikimedia url](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:No_Image_Available.jpg)
- Code: 
    - I spent several hours watching videos by John Elder on his channel [Codemy.com](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCC34OHNcOtqW9BJmgQPPzUpJ8hl49AGy), particularly his Django Wednesdays playlist. It would be impossible to list every line of my code that was influenced by his videos, though his most significant influence was in helping solidify my understanding of the Django framework as a whole.
    - Various forums such as Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow helped to solve small problems when I was stuck on a line of code.
- Individuals:
    - My Mentor, [Adegbenga Adeye](https://github.com/deye9), provided comments and feedback.
    - My wife, Megan, provided wonderful feedback, and, most importantly, saw me through the project by making every break a delight.
